# Geyser Eruption Time Analysis Repository

This GitHub repository contains an analysis of time intervals between eruptions of a geyser. The purpose of this repository is to provide a detailed overview of the data analysis process, including data collection, summary statistics, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and the impact of changing the significance level.

## Contents

- **Datasets**: This repository includes two datasets, one representing recent time intervals between eruptions and another for past time intervals. These datasets contain randomly generated data.

- **Code File**: The code file (geyser_analysis.ipynb) contains the complete analysis of the geyser eruption time intervals. It includes data processing, summary statistics calculation, data visualization using boxplots, and hypothesis testing.

## Analysis Process

The analysis in this repository will follow the following steps:

1. Data Collection: We will share the datasets for both recent and past time intervals between geyser eruptions, generated using random data.

2. Summary Statistics: The code will calculate various summary statistics for each dataset, including the mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, maximum, and minimum.

3. Data Visualization: We will create boxplots to visually describe the distribution of time intervals for recent and past eruptions. The boxplots will provide insights into the shape and spread of the data.

4. Hypothesis Testing: A hypothesis test will be performed to determine whether the mean time intervals between eruptions have changed. The analysis will include the formulation of null and alternative hypotheses, the calculation of the test statistic and p-value, and the interpretation of the statistical conclusion.

5. Significance Level Variation: The hypothesis test will be repeated by changing the significance level (alpha) to 0.01. We will analyze whether the statistical conclusion and interpretation change and explain the reasons for any differences.

Please note that this README.md file provides an overview of the analysis process, and the detailed analysis can be found in the code file within this repository.
